🏆 DRW Crypto Prediction Challenge – Kaggle Competition
This repository contains my solution and experimentation for the DRW Crypto Price Movement Prediction challenge hosted on Kaggle.

🔗 Competition Link: DRW Crypto Prediction Challenge on Kaggle
📅 Duration: March 2024 – June 2025
📊 Objective: Predict short-term price movements in crypto futures using anonymized proprietary features and public market data.

🧠 My Contribution
As a participant, I explored various machine learning models and data processing techniques to extract meaningful signals from high-dimensional and noisy crypto market data. My focus areas included:

Feature engineering and selection from production and public datasets

Time-window-based training (e.g., using the most recent months)

Pearson correlation optimization (competition metric)

Ensuring no future leakage (real-world inference setting)

This project demonstrates my ability to tackle complex financial prediction problems with rigorous modeling and attention to data integrity.

📌 Notes
All predictions are generated using models trained only on data available up to the prediction time, in line with the competition rules.

The final solution achieves a strong Pearson correlation on the validation and private test sets.
